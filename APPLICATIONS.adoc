| Program | Usage
| https://discordapp.com/[*Discord*]
|
Discord is the ultimate cross-platform community chat application for text, 
video, and voice communication, with a whopping 250+ million users worldwide. 
It's like the best of Skype and TeamSpeak³ combined, 
but without any cost and available on every platform,
and dozens of other brand-new features.
Everyone can create his own community server, totally for free with a lot of
settings, permissions, groups, bots, and much more.

.Disclaimer
[NOTE]
However, it's essential to keep in mind that while Discord is an excellent communication tool,
it may not be the most secure chatting application out there. 
It's important to treat every message and chat with caution, 
knowing that anyone could potentially screenshot and read it. 
So, be mindful of the content you share and who you communicate with on the platform.

| Outlook

I especially like it for its Export-to-File Functionality.

OCR with After-Editing features, Conversion to/from other formats.

All-in-one Graphic Design, Screen Capture Software, Image Editor,
Color Picker, Pixel Ruler and More.
Started using it when i started to make pictures for adhoc documentation.

| https://github.com/phw/peek[Peek]
|
Peek makes it easy to create short screencasts of a screen area.
It was built for the specific use case of recording screen areas, e.g. for
easily showing UI features of your own apps or for showing a bug in bug reports.
With Peek, you simply place the Peek window over the area you
want to record and press "Record". Peek is optimized for generating
animated GIFs, but you can also directly record to WebM or MP4 if you prefer.

Only works with Linux in combination with X11
(Wayland support might be added. it got lots of stars and is open source).

| https://sourceforge.net/projects/sagethumbs/[Sagethumbs 2]
| Program which extends the Preview-Icon-Functionality of Windows's Explorer with

FortiExplorer allows one to have access to the FortiOS setup wizard, Web-based
Manager, and a simulated CLI console by connecting the PC to a older Fortinet
Device (e.g. FortiWifi-30D) that has a USB-AB Port. 
It's a standalone Application that also installs some brand-own drivers. 
It was discontinued in 2016 but is still available for download on their 
Support Website (Login needed).

benchmark like every parameter a cpu can possibly have

*Most awesome Skyblock-Idea of all time which i fell in love with*:
*** Concept: Nearly each block in the game has a "material-value". Using
a magic table or chest, you can transform your farmed items into this
value, store it, and also exchange it back into items that match your
gathered value.
*** You can build automated farms to harvest the value and exchange them
into the items you want (e.G: Tubes for Item-Transport, Redstone that
can stick to side of blocks, Block-Breakers, "Solar-like Panels" which
turn sun-energy into the material-value, and much more...)
*** The Modpack includes a big amount of Mods from Tekkit-Lite with
energy but also adds lots of magic (e.G: A ring that lets you fly freely
at the cost of the mentioned material-value)
*** Old Minecraft Version (1.2.5) Vibes hard
