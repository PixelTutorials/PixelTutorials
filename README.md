- 👋 Hi, I’m @PixelTutorials. 
- 🤝 I use GitHub as my primary version control and collaboration platform<sup>*</sup>.
- 👀 My interests and a broad overview of my knowledge 
     can be found on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonas-pammer-2b340a1aa) and [stackshare](https://stackshare.io/privat/my-stack) profiles.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning IaaC with Ansible, GitLab and Amazon S3/EC2.
- 📫 You can reach me under [opensource@jonaspammer.at](mailto: opensource@jonaspammer.at). Please refrain from contacting me over my private or company e-mail.

#### Foot notes
I also sync my projects to a privately hosted GitLab instance.
I do this mainly for archival purposes (GitHub is owned by Microsoft), as well as trying things out as we plan to move to GitLab in our company.
